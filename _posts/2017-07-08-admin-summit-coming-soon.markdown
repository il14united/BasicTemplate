Details for our next quarterly Admin Summit are in the works: If you are the admin of a 14th District Democrat / Progressive / Resist / Action / Indivisible / Bernie etc... Facebook group - an email is headed your way soon!
Therefore, if you are ready to meet and collaborate with like-minded influencers, contribute your ideas and express your concerns, close the communication gap between each other, remove the obstacles that prevent other 14th District voters from finding your Facebook group and commit to creating and taking the next steps in turning the 14th District from RED to BLUE... this meeting is where that begins!
If you are an admin and think we may not have your contact info - send an email with your Facebook group name and your contact details to il14united@gmail.com. You DO NOT want to miss this event!
