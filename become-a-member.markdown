**IL 14 UNITED.com** was created to be a Progressive contrast to the many existing Conservative (Tea Party) websites. These organizations, unlike most Progressive ones, are tight-knit, organized and structured. Their memberships are disciplined and display strong, passionate convictions in what they believe in. They are a force to be reckoned with. Progressives may not agree with Conservatives political beliefs, but we must understand and respect the fact that their communication, mobilization and  education techniques are currently superior to ours.

Members of IL 14 UNITED are defined by our action and find solidarity in our shared opposition to Congressman Randy Hultgren, Trump and Trumpism. Each of us explicitly reserves our individual stances on specific issues for other forums as we believe that supporting a Progressive congressional candidate, while resisting Trump, is far more important than any single issue. We adhere to a Code of Conduct that welcomes and respects everybody.

Members of IL 14 UNITED come from all kinds of backgrounds and political persuasions. Some of us are first-time activists and others have been at this for decades. Most importantly, we are all patriots that want the best for our district and our country *and are willing to work for it!*

Stewardship of IL 14 UNITED is provided by numerous admins from various 14th District Progressive Facebook groups;  visitors and members will get valuable insight as to what's happening in our district. 

**IL 14 UNITED** provides a centralized source for Progressive news and events.  Illinois 14th Congressional district is roughly 1,589 square miles which includes parts of 7 counties (DeKalb, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will), 4 area codes, 83 zip codes and has an estimated 350,000 registered voters. Additionally, more than 30 Progressive Facebook groups are active with a combined membership of over 15,000.
